# Song Play Analysis with S3 and Redshift -- Data Pipelines Project
## Introduction

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring me into the project and expect me to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Overview

This project will introduce the core concepts of Apache Airflow. To complete the project, I will create my own custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.

The project is going to import the data, implement operators, and a set of tasks to complete the data folow within the pipeline as shown below. And the helpers class contains all the SQL transformations to execute it with custom operators.

## Project datasets
For this project, will use two datasets. Here are the s3 links for each:
-   Log data:  `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
-   Song data:  `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

###  Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and event datasets, I'll create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

1.  **songplays**  - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

#### Dimension Tables

2.  **users**  - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
3.  **songs**  - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
4.  **artists**  - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude_
5.  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_

## Project Structure

The project includes files as bellow:

-   The  **dag template**  has all the imports and task templates
-   The  **operators**  folder with operator templates
-   A  **helper class**  for the SQL transformations
- With these files, the graph view of DAG in the Airflow UI should look like this:

## Project Steps


### Configuring the DAG

In the DAG, add  `default parameters`  according to these guidelines

-   The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
-   On failure, the task are retried 3 times
-   Retries happen every 5 minutes
-   Catchup is turned off
-   Do not email on retry

Configure the task dependencies so that after the dependencies are set, the graph view follows the flow shown in the image below.

Working DAG with correct task dependencies

### Building the operators

The project will build four different operators that will __stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality.__

#### Stage Operator

The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.

The parameters should be used to distinguish between JSON file. Another important requirement of the stage operator is containing a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

#### Fact and Dimension Operators

Dimension and fact operators will utilize the SQL helper class to run data transformations. Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. Here will also define a target table that will contain the results of the transformation. Dimension loads are often done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. 

#### Data Quality Operator

The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.

## To Run the Project
### Add Airflow Variables
Go to Airflow UI. From the Admin menu in the top menu bar, select  `Variables`. Create these Variables:

-   `s3_bucket`  which holds the AWS S3 bucket
    
-   `s3_log_key`  which holds the log files key
    
-   `s3_song_key`  which holds the song files key
    
-   `s3_log_json_path_key`  which holds the ''log JSON path file' key
 
### Add Airflow Connections

Here, we'll use Airflow's UI to configure your AWS credentials and connection to Redshift.

1.  To go to the Airflow UI:
    -   Open  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)  in Google Chrome (other browsers occasionally have issues rendering the Airflow UI).
2.  Click on the  **Admin**  tab and select  **Connections**.

4.  On the next create connection page, enter the following values:
    
    -   **Conn Id**: Enter  `redshift`.
    -   **Conn Type**: Enter  `Postgres`.
    -   **Host**: Enter the endpoint of your Redshift cluster, excluding the port at the end. You can find this by selecting your cluster in the  **Clusters**  page of the Amazon Redshift console. See where this is located in the screenshot below. IMPORTANT: Make sure to  **NOT**  include the port at the end of the Redshift endpoint string.
    -   **Schema**: Enter  `dev`. This is the Redshift database you want to connect to.
    -   **Login**: Enter  `awsuser`.
    -   **Password**: Enter the password you created when launching your Redshift cluster.
    -   **Port**: Enter  `5439`.
    
    Once you've entered these values, select  **Save**.
